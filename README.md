- Any script with "_analysis" will produce a diagnostic or output plot. 

- Any script with "_fitter" will do the sampling for a given signal and noise. 

- In each script, you can use keywords "classic", "Sachdev1e", "FOPT" to indicate the signal injected. These signals are defined in the helper script.

- You can also use "HL" or "CE" to choose either A+ or CE noise. These should be automatically implemented based on the variables defined at the beginning of the script. 

- You can also define the observing times you want to run for. These are in an array at the top of the script. I believe they're in seconds but can easily be converted and I try to label with units when I go between seconds and years. 

- These aren't super pretty or clean yet but they work pretty smoothly. 

- The output from each fitter or analysis should have the signal type, noise type, and observing time length in the title.
